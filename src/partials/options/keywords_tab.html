                Here you can add keywords that should be blocked by Keyword Blocker.
                Normally Keyword Blocker only blocks videos if they find the keyword as a separate word in the video title and/or description.
                Using the wildcard mode enables blocking when the keyword is found inside a bigger word.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example if you add test as a blocked keyword a video named "Test Video" will be blocked.
                But videos named testing won't be blocked since test is part of testing and not a word on it's own.
                Be careful with enabling wildcard mode because some words might be perfectly fine as a part of word but not on their own.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keyword blocking is case insensitive and regular expressions are supported for advanced users.
