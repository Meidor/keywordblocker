            <p>
                Keyword Blocker is an extension that can help you block video's on YouTube.
                You can block video's either by keyword or block entire channels.
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed Keyword Blocker originally for my nephew who has special needs and
                needed a way to block certain YouTube video's because he gets scared easily.
                Keyword Blocker still has my nephew and his needs as the main customer but over the years
                it has grown significantly due to requests from other people.
